### Getting started

We have developed a module system that allows developers to create apps that can live in other resources. This makes the
process of creating framework related apps much easier, and keep NPWD as a standalone product you almost don't need to
touch.

To get started, there are a few things we need to go through.

1. Make sure you have the source code of NPWD, and have been able to build it successfully.
2. You have a basic understanding of React, Vue or other web lib/frameworks.

### Setup

Before we can start, we have to download or clone the app template which you can
find [here](https://github.com/project-error/npwd-app-template).
:::tip We recommend renaming the app resource with a prefix. Such as `npwd_appname` or `npwd_framework_appname`. DO NOT
USE `-` as a separator.
:::
Then install all dependencies by running `yarn install` in the root of the app resource.

#### App configuration

Before we can get started with developing the app, we should configure our app.

In `npwd.config.ts` you'll find some a basic config you can change. Most of these are self-explanatory, but we'll go
through some of them.

```ts
export default (settings: Settings) => ({
  // ...
  id: "APP_NAME",
  nameLocale: localizedAppName[settings?.language ?? defaultLanguage],
  icon: AppIcon,
  app: App,
});
```

- `id`: The ID of the app which is mostly used for NUI messages and translation.
- `nameLocale`: This is the current language selected from the phone. You shouldn't need to change this.
- `icon`: The app icon used on the home screen and for notifications
- `app`: This is the DOM element which will be rendered when we navigate to the `path` set in the config.

#### Module federation configuration

This is a simple, but important step.

Navigate to `webpack.config.js` and find `plugins` where you'll see something like this.

```js
// ...
new ModuleFederationPlugin({
	name: 'template',
// ...
```

Change the `name` to the resource name of the app. This will help NPWD locating your app.

### NPWD

Now that we have set up the app, we have to add the app to NPWD. You'll find a file called `config.json`. If you
haven't done any changes, it should look like this

```json
{
  // other configuration
  "apps": []
}
```

The reason we have to set the resource name as `name` in the `Module federation` plugin, is because we get the necassary
files from the resource iframe. So here we can just replace `template` both places with the `resource name` of the app.

```json
{
  // other configuration
  "apps": ["resourcename"]
}
```

If you want more apps, you follow the same steps. Create a new property in the object, and return an import of the
config.

### Development

Now, you can start developing your billion dollar app idea. To see the app in-browser, run `yarn dev` in
the `app resource`.

Alternatively, you run `yarn start` in `npwd/phone` to see the app inside NPWD in-browser.

#### Useful hooks and functions

While developing, there are a few things to keep in mind. Sending NUI messages are with `SendNUIMessage` will not work.
We have therefore created a client-side export `sendUIMessage` from NPWD. You can read more about
that [here](https://projecterror.dev/docs/npwd/api/client-exports).

We can intercept these NUI message with the `useNuiEvent` hook, and use the data returned.

```ts
const { data } = useNuiEvent<T>({ event: "RANDOM" });
```

:::important
If you're using the `fetchNui` function, you need to hardcode the name in. If not, all the requests will go to NPWD, instead of your app resource.

```js
// ...

const resourceName = "resourcename";

// ...
```

:::
If you want to fetch data from the client via NUI, you can utilise the `fetchNui` function. This works like a normal
POST req, and requires `RegisterNUICallback` on the client-side. Then use the callback provided by `RegisterNUICallback`
to a send response back.

## Build

Since we're loading these apps dynamically, you don't have to rebuild NPWD at all :)
